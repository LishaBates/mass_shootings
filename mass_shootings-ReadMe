## General Info
A friend and I were talking about mass shootings and I mentioned it is mainly white men who are the shooter. My friend did not believe me and to be honest that is just what I had always heard and I never personally pulled up the data.
Therefore, I went home after that lunch date and did some digging around. I found a great data set with data from 1982 - 2022 and more info than I could have ever imagined!

## The Data

MotherJones.com: **[Guide to Mass Shootings in America](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)** <br>

Here is a description of the criteria used by MotherJones.com:

<p>The perpetrator took the lives of at least four people. A 2008 FBI report identifies an individual as a mass murderer—versus a spree killer or a serial killer—if he kills four or more people in a single incident (not including himself), typically in a single location. (*In 2013, the US government’s fatality baseline was revised down to three; our database reflects this change beginning from Jan. 2013, as detailed above.)
<p>The killings were carried out by a lone shooter. (Except in the case of the Columbine massacre and the Westside Middle School killings, which involved two shooters.)
<p>The shootings occurred in a public place. (Except in the case of a party on private property in Crandon, Wisconsin, and another in Seattle, where crowds of strangers had gathered, essentially constituting a public crowd.) Crimes primarily related to gang activity or armed robbery are not included, nor are mass killings that took place in private homes (often stemming from domestic violence).
<p>Perpetrators who died or were wounded during the attack are not included in the victim tallies.
<p>We included a handful of cases also known as “spree killings“—cases in which the killings occurred in more than one location, but still over a short period of time, that otherwise fit the above criteria.
